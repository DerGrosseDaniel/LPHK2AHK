# LPHK2AHK
This project makes it easy to use a Novation Launchpad with Autohotkey.

## Basic idea
I wanted something like [LaunchPad HotKey](https://github.com/nimaid/LPHK) for an interface but the Autohotkey to write the macros.
My solution to this is to use LaunchPad HotKey to trigger key combinations with F13-F24 and then capture those in AHK and write my automations.
The macros in LaunchPad HotKey don't have to be touched now, and only the colors will be set here.

## Setup
1. Install [LaunchPad HotKey](https://github.com/nimaid/LPHK)
2. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
3. run LaunchPad HotKey with lphk2ahk.lpl (here you change the keycolors)
4. run lhpk2ahk_blank.ahk (here you change the bindings and write your macros)
